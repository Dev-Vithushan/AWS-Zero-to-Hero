# Basic Concepts of the Cloud Computing  üöÄ

## üßê What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud") instead of using local servers or personal devices. It allows users to access and use various resources like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics on-demand


## üîë key concepts of cloud computing

1. `On-Demand Self-Service` 
- Users can provision resources as needed automatically without requiring human intervention from the service provider. This includes computing power, storage, and network resources.
2.  `Broad Network Access` 
- Cloud services are accessible over the network using standard mechanisms (e.g., the internet) and can be accessed through a variety of devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
3. `Resource Pooling` 
- Providers pool their resources to serve multiple customers using a multi-tenant model. Resources are dynamically allocated and reassigned according to demand. This includes computing resources like storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
4. `Rapid Elasticity` 
- Cloud computing provides flexibility by allowing users to scale resources up or down based on their needs. This elasticity ensures efficient use of resources and handles peak loads without downtime.
5. `Measured Service (Pay-as-You-Go)`  
- Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability. Users only pay for the resources they consume, such as storage, bandwidth, or CPU usage.
6. `Cloud Security` 
- Data Encryption: Ensures that data stored and transmitted via the cloud is protected from unauthorized access.

- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Tools to control user access to cloud resources.

7. `Serverless Computing`
- Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing servers. The cloud provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure. Example: AWS Lambda.
